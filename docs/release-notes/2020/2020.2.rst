Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ewald dipole correction incorrect without domain decomposition
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Ewald dipole correction (epsilon-surface != 0) is now disabled when not
using domain decomposition. With domain decomposition, it only works
when each molecule consists of a single update group (e.g. water).
This will be fixed in release-2021.
